Design Philosophy

Think Bloomberg Terminal meets Swiss Private Bank UX — hyper‑efficient data density, authoritative typography, seamless dark‑mode interface, and a sense of control without confusion.

The interface must convey confidence, traceability, and command — not clutter, guesswork, or “AI magic.”

Mental Model: Explainability Visualization

Three Levels of Logic Display

Outcome Summary

Final conclusion with a confidence ribbon

Risk badges: Legal, Compliance, Unknowns

Causal Map

Directed graph traces logic:

inputs → evidence nodes → inference nodes → conclusion

edge weights = confidence

Chronological Vault

Time‑stamped reasoning log

Tool calls

Policy checks passed

Escalations

This is more than a dashboard — it’s an argument reconstructor for boards and courts.

Trust UI Components
1) Veracity Ribbon

Color coded confidence + legal robustness tier

Includes explainability assurance score

CEO instantly knows “safe to act” vs “need review”

2) Explainability Timeline

Time axis with rollback points

Slide to inspect causal justification at any juncture

3) Policy Radar

Highlights which policy (GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act, FINRA) applies to each decision

Inline legal snippets explain compliance rationale

Interaction Principles

First: No hidden logic. Every piece of output must be traceable back through a chain you can show a regulator.

Second: Layered depth. Analysts should feel less overwhelmed than with a spreadsheet, because logic is structured, not buried.

Third: Immediate confidence cues. A CEO should feel like the system is a commander’s briefing — succinct, data‑dense, but never cryptic.
